# **3D GameBoy**

This 3D GameBoy is created with `CSS` and `Vanilla JavaScript` for a 2nd year school project.


## **GameBoy Game**

* You can enjoy this **TicTacToe Game** in the GameBoy.
* I decided to do another style of GameBoy, to create something that we don't usually find. This GameBoy was the one I used whe I was young so I also wanted to develop it. I've put my inspiration model in the files.
* `Special Thanks`  I would like to thank my friend, Robin Bourachot, who is with me in class for explaining to me the computer and table parts, because I was a little bit confused and blocked in these parts.

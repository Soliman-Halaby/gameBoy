# **3D GameBoy**

This 3D GameBoy is created with `CSS` and `JavaScript`.

## **GameBoy Game**

* You can enjoy this **TicTacToe Game** in the GameBoy.
* I decided to do another style of GameBoy, to create something that we don't usually find, and I've put my inspiration model in the files.
* `Special Thanks`  I would like to thank Robin Bourachot who is with me in class for explaining to me the computer part, because I was a little bit confused and blocked in this part.
